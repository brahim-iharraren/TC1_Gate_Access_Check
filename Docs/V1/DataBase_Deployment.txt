# Database Deployment Steps – GATE ACCESS CONTROL CHECK

## Objective

Deploy and initialize the Gate Access Control database required for application operation.


## 1. Pre-Requisites

* SQL Server installed and running.
* ODBC Driver 17 installed on the application server.
* Database credentials configured in `.env`:

  * `DB_DATA_SOURCE`
  * `DB_INITIAL_CATALOG`
  * `DB_USER_ID`
  * `DB_PASSWORD`
* Network connectivity verified (Port 1433 open).

## 2. Database Deployment

* Ensure the database server is accessible.
* Run the database initialization script once the environment is ready:

```
python3 -m create_database
```

* This will create the required database and tables automatically and populate initial data.


## 3. Verification

* Confirm the database and tables are created.
* Check that initial data has been populated.
* Validate connectivity from the application server.
* Review logs to ensure no errors occurred.

## 4. Production Considerations

* Ensure database backups are available.
* Limit access to authorized IPs.
* Rotate credentials according to IT security policy.
