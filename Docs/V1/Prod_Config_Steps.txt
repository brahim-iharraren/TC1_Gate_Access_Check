**Objective:** Prepare and configure the Gate Access Control system in a controlled production environment.

**Step-by-Step Process:**

1. **Environment Setup**
   * Ensure production server meets hardware and OS requirements.
   * Verify firewall rules allow access to required ports (`PORT`) and network interfaces.

2. **Application Deployment**
   * Copy the validated pre-production package to the production server.
   * Replace `.env` file with production credentials:
     * `DB_DATA_SOURCE`, `DB_USER_ID`, `DB_PASSWORD`
     * `ADDR`, `PORT`, `SECRET_KEY`
   * Ensure proper permissions for the application user.

3. **Database Configuration**
   * Validate the production database schema (`gate_access_db`).
   * Confirm production database connectivity.
   * Apply any migration scripts required for production.

4. **Dependencies Verification**
   * Install required Python packages as per `requirements.txt`.
   * Confirm Python version and system libraries are compatible with the application.

5. **Starting the Application**
   * Start the application with Hypercorn:
     ```bash
     hypercorn app_module:app --bind 0.0.0.0:<PRODUCTION_PORT>
     ```
   * Enable any reverse proxy if required (Nginx, Apache).
   * Verify HTTPS and SSL certificates if applicable.

6. **Validation and Testing**
   * Test login and CRUD operations on production database.
   * Verify logging in `App_LOG/`.
   * Confirm access from all authorized client machines.

7. **Monitoring and Maintenance**
   * Schedule automated log rotation.
