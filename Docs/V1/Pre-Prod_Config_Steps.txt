GATE ACCESS CONTROL CHECK Pre-Production Configuration Steps

**Objective:** Prepare and configure the Gate Access Control system in a controlled pre-production environment for testing and validation before moving to production.

**Step-by-Step Process:**

1. **Environment Setup**

   * Ensure the pre-production server meets the required specifications: OS, RAM, CPU, and network connectivity.
   * Verify access to the database server (credentials stored in `.env`).

2. **Application Configuration**

   * Clone the Gate Access Control repository or copy the deployment package.
   * Ensure `.env` file contains pre-production credentials:

     * `DB_DATA_SOURCE`
     * `DB_USER_ID` / `DB_PASSWORD`
     * `ADDR` / `PORT`
     * `SECRET_KEY`
   * Verify network interface configuration (`INTERFACE` and `TARGET_SUBNET` values).

3. **Database Setup**

   * Create or validate the pre-production database and tables (`gate_access_db`).
   * Run SQL scripts to initialize tables if not present.
   * Confirm connectivity from the application server to the database.

4. **Dependencies Installation**

   * Ensure Python 3.10+ is installed.
   * Install required packages from `requirements.txt` including:

     * `starlette`, `hypercorn`, `python-dotenv`, `pyodbc`, `fastapi-login`.

5. **Service Start and Testing**

   * Start the server with Hypercorn using the pre-production configuration:

     ```bash
     hypercorn app_module:app --bind 127.0.0.1:2250
     ```
   * Verify that endpoints `/Gate/home`, `/Gate/logs`, `/Gate/login` are reachable.
   * Perform test logins with pre-production credentials.
   * Validate database operations (add-person, check-eligibility).

6. **Monitoring and Logging**

   * Confirm logging is operational in `App_LOG/`.
   * Verify that logs are readable via `/Gate/logs` and `/Gate/readLogs`.
